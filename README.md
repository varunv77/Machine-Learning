# Machine Learning Repository
## Overview
This repository houses machine learning practice projects created while honing skills in the field of machine learning during the IIT-Kanpur Intensive Training School conducted by Dr. Aditya K Jagannatham. These projects are designed for learning and experimentation with various machine learning frameworks and technologies.
## Technologies Used
- **Scikit-learn:** A versatile machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling.


- **Keras:** A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow or other deep learning libraries.


- **TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team, widely used for deep learning applications.


- **Pandas:** A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, essential for handling structured data.


- **NumPy:** The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.


- **Seaborn:** A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, designed to produce informative and attractive statistical graphics.



## Projects Structure
- **Data Preprocessing:** Dedicated to data cleaning, feature engineering, and preparation for subsequent model training.

- **Model_Training:** Implementation of machine learning models using Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, emphasizing experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation metrics and techniques to rigorously assess the performance of trained models.

- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes Seaborn and other visualization tools to gain insights into data patterns and model performance.
